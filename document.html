    <p>git init</p>
    <p>git status</p>
    <p>git add (selector)</p>
    <p>git add . : add all files</p>
    <p>git rm --cached -r (selector) : back to unCommit status</p>
    <p>git rm --cached -r filename : filename is insert back to unCommit status</p>
    <p>git rm --cached -r . : back to unCommit status all file from commit status</p>

        if your repository in process and out of your access : Another git process seems to be running in this repository
        you must write this code --> rm -f .git/index.lock      || If there is no index.lock file there, check for HEAD.lockÂ· Removing it solved the problem for me.

    <p>git rm used for remove file from git staging step but after staging step git rm is not used for remove</p>

        Deleting the .git folder may cause problems in your git repository. If you want to delete all your commit history but keep the code in its current state, it is very safe to do it as in the following:
        Checkout

        --->    git checkout --orphan latest_branch

        Add all the files

        --->    git add -A

        Commit the changes

        --->    git commit -am "commit message"

        Delete the branch

        --->    git branch -D main

        Rename the current branch to main

        --->    git branch -m main

        Finally, force update your repository

        --->    git push -f origin main

        PS: this will not keep your old commit history around
    </p>
